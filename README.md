Welcome to the Netflix Data Analysis project, a comprehensive exploration of Netflix's content catalog. In this project, I meticulously examined Netflix's raw data, employed rigorous analytical process to ensure accuracy and reliability. From data extraction, cleaning to visualization, every step I've performed with precision and attention to detail.

Data Analysis Steps
My approach involves a series of meticulous steps to derive meaningful insights from the data:
1.	Data Extraction: The raw dataset is got by someone as a csv file I import to google colab.
2.	Data Cleaning: Applied Rigorous cleaning procedures, addressing issues like duplicates, spelling errors, and inconsistent formats.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employed EDA techniques to understand the data, identify patterns, and unveil trends. This includes statistical calculations, visualizations, and correlation analyses.
4.	Data Preparation: Prepared The dataset for visualization, involving the creation of new variables and necessary data filtering.
5.	Data Visualization: Utilized Excel to craft visually appealing charts and graphs that succinctly present the analysis findings!


Recommendations:

1) Netflix should continue to invest in original content, as this is what sets it aparts from other streming servies.
2) Netflix should promate the work of popular director and geners to users.
3) Netflix should focus on expending its content library in countries where it is still reletivly new.

Insights:

It's clear that Netflix has grown over the years. We can see it from the data that the company took certain approaches in their marketing strategy to break into new markets around the world. Based on an article from Business Insider, Netflix had about 158 million subscribers worldwide with 60 million from the US and almost 98 million internationally. Netflix's original subscriber base was based solely in the United States following its IPO. A large part of its success was due to the decision to expand to international markets. The popular markets prioritizes what content the company will release. In this case, we can see that a good amount of international movies and TV shows were added over the years as part of Netflix's global expansion
